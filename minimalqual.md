# Minimal Qualification Program

&nbsp;

The minimal qualification program prepares the graduate students toward being qualified for the PhD research and future career in Loop Quantum Gravity. The program includes two aspects: The fundamentals and The research qualification. The students are expected to finish the qualifications in about 2 years but no more than 3 years.

This program shares similarity to some specialized master programs in Europe and in China, where the master students finish a set of specialized courses and start to research. The period of 2-3 years master studies often plays a crucial role for the students' development, and it may even determine the levels of students' future research, because the students have to make the trasition from their education phase to the research phase within these 2-3 years, and the master studies builds the inital condition for the students' research life. The purpose of the minimal qualificaiton program is to help the students make the successful transition and have an excellent starting point for their research career.

## The Fundamentals

The student needs to have solid knowledge in the subjects that are closely related to the research field. The successful candidate needs to pass the written exams (the Minimal Qualification Exams) for 3 core subjects and one of the 2 elective subjects. It is allowed that the student focuses on one subject for certain period and takes the exam of the subject right after. The following lists all the core and elective subjects, examination syllabi, and references. Some good online resources may be found in e.g. the PSI program (PIRSA video library) at Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics

## Research Qualification

The student must finish independently at least one research paper. The paper is expected to be published in a leading journal of physics. 

The student will have an oral exam to report the research results at the end of this program. The student's research paper, oral and written exams will be evaluated by an international committee, which decides the final grade of the student.
