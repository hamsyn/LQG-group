# Minimal Qualification Program

&nbsp;

The minimal qualification program prepares the graduate students toward being qualified for the PhD research and future career in Loop Quantum Gravity. The program includes two aspects: The fundamentals and The research qualification. The students have about two years to finish this program. 


## The Fundamentals

The students need to have solid knowledge in 3 core subjects and one of 2 elective subjects. The successful candidates needs to pass the exams (the Minimal Qualification Exams), one for each subject. The following lists all the subjects and their examination syllabi.

### Core Subject 1: General Relativity

Manifold and tensor field, metric tensor, covariant derivative, geodesics, curvature and its computation, special relativity, Einstein equation and solutions, Linearized gravity, homogeneous and isotropic cosmology, the Schwarzschild spacetime, Reissner–Nordström spacetime, Kerr-Newman spacetime, black holes, dS and AdS spacetimes, initial value formulation of general relativity, asymptotic flatness, spinors, quantum field theory on curved spacetimes, Hawking and Unruh effects, black hole thermodynamics. Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations of gravity
