# Minimal Qualification Program

&nbsp;

The minimal qualification program prepares the graduate students toward being qualified for the PhD research and future career in Loop Quantum Gravity. The program includes two aspects: The fundamentals and The research qualification. The students are expected to finish the qualifications in about 2 years but no more than 3 years.

&nbsp;

## The Fundamentals

The student needs to have solid knowledge in 3 core subjects and one of 2 elective subjects. The successful candidate needs to pass the written exams (the Minimal Qualification Exams), one for each subject. It is allowed that the student focuses on one subject for certain period and takes the exam right after. The following lists all the subjects, examination syllabi, and references. Some good online resources may be found in e.g. the PSI program (PIRSA video library) at Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics

### Core Subject 1: General Relativity

### Elective Subject 2: Numerical Methods




&nbsp;

## Research Qualification

The student must finish independently at least one research paper. The paper is expected to be published in a leading journal of physics. 

The student will have an oral exam to report the research results at the end of this program. The student's research paper, oral and written exams will be evaluated by an international committee, which decides the final grade of the student.
