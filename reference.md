The following are two recommended review papers for beginning PhD students to prepare their research on Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG): 

- Muxin Han, Weiming Huang, Yongge Ma, _Fundamental Structure of Loop Quantum Gravity_, [arXiv:gr-qc/0509064](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0509064) (Introductory review containing enough details for the canonical approach of LQG)

- Alejandro Perez, _The Spin Foam Approach to Quantum Gravity_, [arXiv:1205.2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2019) (Review on the Spin Foam approach of LQG)

&nbsp;

A few other important review references on LQG:

- Thomas Thiemann, _Mordern Quantum Canonical General Relativity_, Cambridge University Press 2008 (This book contains detailed discussions of almost all aspects in LQG)

- Carlo Rovelli, Francesca Vidotto, _Covariant Loop Quantum Gravity: An Elementary Introduction to Quantum Gravity and Spinfoam Theory_, Cambridge University Press 2014 (This book focuses on the Spin Foam approach of LQG, and discusses many very recent progresses)

- Abhay Ashtekar, Jerzy Lewandowski, _Background Independent Quantum Gravity: A Status Report_, Class. Quant. Grav.21:R53,2004 (Pedagogical overview of the basics of LQG for non-experts)
