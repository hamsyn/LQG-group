The following are two recommended review papers for beginning PhD students to prepare their research on Loop Quantum Gravity: 

### Introductory review of Loop Quantum Gravity:

- Muxin Han, Weiming Huang, Yongge Ma, _Fundamental Structure of Loop Quantum Gravity_, [arXiv:gr-qc/0509064](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0509064)


### Review on Spin Foam Approach to Loop Quantum Gravity:

- Alejandro Perez, _The Spin Foam Approach to Quantum Gravity_, [arXiv:1205.2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2019)


Two other important references for research on LQG:

### The book containing detailed discussions of almost all aspects of Loop Quantum Gravity

- Thomas Thiemann, _Mordern Quantum Canonical General Relativity_, Cambridge University Press 2008

### The book focusing on the covariant approach of Loop Quantum Gravity and Spin Foams, and discussing many very recent progresses

- Carlo Rovelli, Francesca Vidotto, _Covariant Loop Quantum Gravity: An Elementary Introduction to Quantum Gravity and Spinfoam Theory_, Cambridge University Press 2014
