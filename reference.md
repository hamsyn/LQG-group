The following are two recommended review papers for beginning PhD students to prepare their research on Loop Quantum Gravity: 

- Muxin Han, Weiming Huang, Yongge Ma, _Fundamental Structure of Loop Quantum Gravity_, [arXiv:gr-qc/0509064](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0509064) (Introductory review containing enough details for the canonical approach of Loop Quantum Gravity)

- Alejandro Perez, _The Spin Foam Approach to Quantum Gravity_, [arXiv:1205.2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2019) (Review on the Spin Foam approach of Loop Quantum Gravity)

&nbsp;

Two other important references for research on LQG:

- Thomas Thiemann, _Mordern Quantum Canonical General Relativity_, Cambridge University Press 2008 (This book contains detailed discussions of almost all aspects in Loop Quantum Gravity)

- Carlo Rovelli, Francesca Vidotto, _Covariant Loop Quantum Gravity: An Elementary Introduction to Quantum Gravity and Spinfoam Theory_, Cambridge University Press 2014 (This book focuses on the Spin Foam approach of Loop Quantum Gravity, and discusses many very recent progresses)
