#### Effective dynamics of Loop Quantum Gravity and a top-down approach to cosmological singularity resolution

A new routine is proposed to relate Loop Quant Cosmology (LQC) to Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) from the perspective of effective dynamics. We derive the big-bang singularity resolution and big bounce from the first principle of full canonical LQG. Our results are obtained in the framework of the reduced phase space quantization of LQG. As a key step in our work, we derive with coherent states a new discrete path integral formula of the transition amplitude generated by the physical Hamiltonian. The semiclassical approximation of the path integral formula gives an interesting set of effective equations of motion (EOMs) for full LQG. When solving the EOMs with homogeneous and isotropic ansatz, we reproduce the LQC effective dynamics in Î¼0-scheme. The solution replaces the big-bang singularity by a big bounce.

### How to Join the Group:

<!-- Fudan-FAU Joint Postdoctoral Position in Quantum Gravity -->

We are able to host Fyodor Lynen Postdoctoral Fellowship of the Humboldt foundation. See [Fyodor Lynen Fellowship](https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/web/lynen-fellowship.html) for details.

For PhD students, please apply officially for the graduate fellowships in the Department of Physics at FAU. See [Graduate Admissions](http://www.physics.fau.edu/graduate-admissions/index.php) for details. The GRE Physics Subject score is the most important factor in the PhD student selection. The GRE general score is not required. Students whose first language is not English must submit TOEFL scores. FAU requires a minimum TOEFL score of 550 on the paper-based test, or 80 on the internet-based test. FAU also accepts IELTS test results with a minimum score of 6.5. See [here](http://www.fau.edu/admissions/international/requirements.php) for details.
