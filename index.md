### How to Join the Group:

Fudan-FAU Joint Postdoctoral Position in Quantum Gravity

We are able to host Fyodor Lynen Postdoctoral Fellowship of the Humboldt foundation. See [Fyodor Lynen Fellowship](https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/web/lynen-fellowship.html) for details.

For PhD students, please apply officially the graduate fellowships in the Department of Physics at FAU. See [Graduate Admissions](http://www.physics.fau.edu/graduate-admissions/index.php) for details. The GRE Physics Subject score is the most important factor in the PhD student selection. The GRE general score is not required.
